This is just a minor up-grade from last year project, changes are mainly  
water tight compartment in particular by numerous trial and error.  
This was a 3 days plan but it took 1 more day than I expected.

Compactment was China made cheap alternative, with 3-d print level stand  
and bunch of re-wiring, picture should be self-explanatory.
